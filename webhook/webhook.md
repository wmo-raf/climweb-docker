# CMS webhooks

Here we define [Webhooks](https://github.com/adnanh/webhook) that trigger scripts to help us with some automations.

The [hooks definition](https://github.com/adnanh/webhook/blob/master/docs/Hook-Definition.md) is in the `hooks.yaml.sample` file.

The scripts to be triggered as defined in the scripts folder.

The `cms-upgrade` hook triggers automated upgrades of the CMS to a newer version.
